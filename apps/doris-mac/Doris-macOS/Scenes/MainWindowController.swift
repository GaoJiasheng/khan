/// Manually-managed main window. Replaces the SwiftUI `Window("Doris",
/// id: "main")` scene because that scene was auto-instantiating its
/// window on app launch / activation despite our four
/// `applicationShouldOpenUntitledFile` / `NSQuitAlwaysKeepsWindows` /
/// `applicationShouldHandleReopen` / `applicationSupportsSecureRestorableState`
/// suppressors. SwiftUI's `Window` scene type maintains its own
/// activation reflexes that those overrides don't fully reach.
///
/// With this controller:
///   - Nothing happens at launch — the window object isn't even created.
///   - First call to `show()` lazily builds the `NSWindow` +
///     `NSHostingController(MainWindowView)` and orders it front.
///   - Subsequent calls to `show()` reuse the same instance (single-window
///     semantics, like the previous `Window` scene gave us).
///   - Closing the window doesn't quit the app — the controller keeps
///     the (hidden) window around so the next `show()` is instant and
///     state-preserving.
