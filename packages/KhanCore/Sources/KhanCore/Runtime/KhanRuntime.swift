/// so the main window, the menu-bar dropdown, the share extension's
/// in-process router, and any background services all share **one**
/// SwiftData backing store.
///
/// Why this exists: previously, KhanApp.swift and AppDelegate.swift each
/// called `ModelContainerFactory.make(...)` independently. In dev mode
/// (in-memory store) that meant the main window's notes and the dropdown
/// panel's notes were in two unrelated containers — edits in one never
/// surfaced in the other. Even on disk, two `NSPersistentCloudKitContainer`s
/// pointing at the same SQLite file is asking for corruption.
///
/// `KhanRuntime` is a `@MainActor` final class so accessing `.shared` from
/// SwiftUI views and AppDelegate hooks is safe. Container construction is
/// lazy on first read — it picks dev/in-memory vs CloudKit-backed based on
/// `SyncSettings.shared.cloudKitEnabled`.
